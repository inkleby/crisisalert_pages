and the steadiness and unconquerable spirit which have been equally displayed by the troops of the three nations united under his command: "That we rejoice to learn that the termination of the armistice in the north of Europe, and the declaration of war by the emperor of Austria against France, have been most happily accompanied by a system of cordial union and concert amongst, the allied powers, and that the effects of this union have even surpassed those expectations which it was calculated to excite: "That, by the signal victories obtained over the French in Silesia, at Culm, and at Denevitz, the efforts of the enemy to penetrate into the heart of the Austrian and Prussian territories were completely frustrated: "That these successes have been followed by a course of operations, conceived with so much judgment, and executed with such consummate prudence, vigour, and ability, as to have led, in their result, not only to the discomfiture of all those projects which the Ruler of France had so presumptuously announced on the renewal of the contest, but to the capture and destruction of the greater part of the army under his immediate command: 27 "That, whilst we are convinced the annals of Europe afford no example of victories more splendid and decisive than those which have been recently achieved in Saxony, whilst the perseverance and gallantry displayed by the allied forces of every description engaged in this conflict have exalted to the highest pitch of glory their military character, we gratefully render the full tribute of our applause to those sovereigns and princes who, in the sacred cause of national independence, have so eminently distinguished themselves, as the leaders of the armies of their respective nations: "To return his Royal Highness our humble thanks for his gracious intention of directing copies of the several conventions which his Royal Highness has concluded with the northern powers to be laid before us as soon as the ratifications of them shall have been duly exchanged; and to assure his Royal Highness that he may rely on our disposition to afford his Royal Highness the necessary assistance in support of a system of alliance which, originating chiefly in the magnanimous and disinterested views of the emperor of Russia, and followed up as it has been with corresponding energy by the other allied powers, has produced a change the most auspicious in the affairs of the continent: "That we learn, with the utmost satisfaction, that his Royal Highness has concluded a treaty of alliance and concert with the emperor of Austria; that the powerful league already formed has received an important addition of force by the declaration of Bavaria against France; and that the ancient connection with the Austrian government has been so happily renewed; and to assure his Royal Highness, that, while we duly appreciate all the value of the accession of that; great power to the common cause, we shall proceed without delay to consider of the means of enabling his Royal Highness to support his imperial majesty in the vigorous prosecution of the contest: "That we cannot but lament the continuance of the War between this country and the United States of America, but that we fully share the satisfaction expressed by his Royal Highness that the measures adopted for the conquest of Canada have been frustrated by the valour of his Majesty's troops, and by the zeal and loyalty of his American subjects: "That it must be matter of deep regret 28 to find that, whilst Great Britain, in conjunction with her allies, is exerting her utmost strength against the common enemy of independent nations, we have to contend against a country whose real interests in the issue of this great contest must be the same as our own: "That we are concerned to learn that his Royal Highness has not hitherto seen any disposition on the part of the United States of which he could avail himself, consistently with a due attention to the interests of his Majesty's subjects, to put an end to a war, in which; undoubtedly this country was not the aggressor: "That we receive with great satisfaction his Royal Highness's gracious assurance that he is at all times ready to enter into discussion with that government for a conciliatory adjustment of the differences between the two countries, upon principles of perfect reciprocity not inconsistent with the established maxims of public law and with the maritime rights of the British empire: "To return our humble thanks to his Royal Highness for having directed the estimates for the service of the ensuing year to be laid before us: "To assure his Royal Highness, that, while we regret the necessity of a large expenditure, we are fully sensible of, the necessity of great military exertions, and shall readily furnish such supplies as the public service, in <b>This Momentous Crisis</b>, may require: "That we must, at the present moment, receive with peculiar satisfaction the assurance of the flourishing state of our commerce: and we are grateful to the bounty of Divine Providence for the abundant harvest of the present year, which must afford material relief to his Majesty's people, and produce a considerable augmentation in many branches of the revenue: "That we rejoice to learn that a decided conviction now happily prevails throughout a large portion of Europe, that the war in which the allied, powers are engaged against the Ruler of France is a war of necessity, and that his views of universal dominion can only be defeated by combined and determined resistance, and that the public spirit and national enthusiasm which have successively accomplished the deliverance of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, and of the Russian empire, now equally animate the German people; and we entertain the fullest confidence, 29 that the same perseverance on their part will ultimately lead to the same glorious result: "That, while we most deeply deplore the continuance of this extended warfare, and of all those miseries which the insatiable ambition of the1 Ruler of France has so long inflicted upon Europe, we receive with peculiar satisfaction the proof of the wisdom and moderation which animate the councils of his Royal Highness and the allies, afforded by the declaration of his Royal Highness, that no disposition to require from France sacrifices of any description inconsistent with her honour or just pretensions as a nation, will ever be an obstacle to peace, and that the restoration of that great blessing, upon principles of justice and equality, has never ceased to be the anxious wish of his Royal Highness; but that we are fully sensible that it can only be obtained by a continuance of those efforts which have already delivered so large a part of Europe from the power of the enemy: "To beseech his Royal Highness to believe that, whilst we look back with Satisfaction and pride on the firmness and perseverance of this: country, to which these advantages may in a great degree be ascribed, we are fully prepared for such new exertions as the nature of the contest may demand, by the happy effect of which we entertain the confident hope that his Royal Highness will be enabled to bring this long and arduous struggle to a conclusion which will be consistent with the independence of all the nations engaged in it, and with the general security of Europe".</p></div><div class="panel-footer" style="background-color:#bce8f1"><p><sub>The Prince Regent'S Speech On Opening The Session.]</sub></p><p>Earl Compton - <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1813/nov/04/the-prince-regents-speech-on-opening-the#column_23" target="_blank">Nov. 4, 1813</a></p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-4"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-body"><p>What the steps were which would be taken by all parties in <b>This Momentous Crisis</b>, he knew not;
